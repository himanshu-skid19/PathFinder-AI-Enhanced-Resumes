• Submitted our research paper to the CVPR 2024 conference, with an improvement of 1.36% over the state-of-the-art on

the Weakly-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection task on the UCF-Crime and ShanghaiTech datasets.

• Proposed a novel Temporal Aggregation Module which is based on Disentangled Cross Attention to aggregate the

representations of multiple backbones and distil the knowledge using Bi-level Knowledge Distillation.

• Proposed a new Black Hole Router Attack threat model on Network-on-chip on the cache, processor and network levels.
• Analyzing the impact on L1 and L2 cache misses and penalties, CPU-wise IPC values and average packet latency using

the gem5 simulator, and coming up with possible detection and mitigation techniques for such attacks.
