• Developed Swin-T and MoViNet-A2 model extraction pipelines through synthetic query generation using image datasets.
• Trained Temporal Segment Networks (TSNs) and EfficientNet-LSTM models in Greybox and Blackbox settings.
• Used multiple stacked image sets to craft adversarial samples and performed class-based analysis to extract model

parameters.

Route Planning and Optimization with Volume Estimation for Last-Mile Deliveries
Inter-IIT Tech Meet, 2023 (held at IIT Kanpur)

• Performed volumetric weight estimation of objects using a stereoscopic RGB Camera setup and developed an end-to-end

physical system to measure the dimensions of the object with very low latency and ∼95% accuracy.

• Used DNNs to classify the shape of the object and for background removal to estimate the pixel per metric ratio. Used

similarity scaling and background averaging to predict accurate object height.

• Optimized the last-mile-delivery problem by devising optimal rider routes, incorporating dynamic pickups and forming

rider bags using 3-D Bin Packing heuristics. Improved scalability by using an iterative sweep clustering algorithm.

NanoC Compiler

• Developed a compiler for Nano-C, a subset language of C having essential features like I/O management, error-handling,

and control statements using Lex, Bison, and C++.

• Implemented generation of assembly language quads for the given code and an executable for the same.
